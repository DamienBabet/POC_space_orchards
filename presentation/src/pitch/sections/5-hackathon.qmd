## Are the results reliable ?

Correctly estimating land cover area is a **hard problem**

## Model performance

We assess the model predictive performance relative to the CLC+ reference 

We use cross-entropy loss with or without weights

and track intersection over union (IOU) for the "1: sealed" CLC+ category

Test sample metrics:
IOU "1/ sealed" category:   0.34
IOU all categories:         0.57

Next step is confronting with ground truth data: LUCAS survey points

## A good predictor is not enough
- A predictor can be good but biased. Cross-entropy **is** biased when we use **weights**
- Unbiased errors can translate to bias when measuring evolutions
- Fundamentally, results depend on resolution, due to the fractal nature of artificialisation

These problems might exist already for CLC+
