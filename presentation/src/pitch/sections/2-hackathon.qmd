## Land Use Change
[**EU Regulation on the Inclusion of Greenhouse Gas emissions and Removals from Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF)**]

We focus on artificialisation, defined here as a rise in imperviousness :
"the disappearance of natural spaces under concrete or bitumen"

Imperviousness negatively affects biodiversity, carbon storage and sequestration, soil hydrological properties, ecosystem services and nature conservation.

The European Commission’s roadmap to a resource efficient Europe introduced a [**‘no net land take by 2050’* initiative**]

## CLC+ Backbone
Land cover and land use: an important topic with [**a lot**] of work. The most recent and performant is the Corine Land Cover Plus (CLC+) Backbone

Everything we did is built on the CLC+ Backbone :

## CLC+ is looking for use cases
